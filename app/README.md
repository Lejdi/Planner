# Planner

Planner is a TODO app made to practice clean architecture and new technologies.  
The app is written in MVI architecture with usage of technologies such as:
 - Room DB
 - Kotlin Flow
 - Jetpack Compose
 - Jetpack Datastore
 - Hilt
 - Shared Element Transition 

### Plans for future development
 - UI tests in Espresso or Cucumber
 - Unit tests
 - integrate Room with kotlin flows - emit values on every change instead of manually refreshing list
 - some backend integration?
